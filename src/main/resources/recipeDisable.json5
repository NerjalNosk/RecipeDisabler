   * Hello there! thanks for using my mod!
   * You guessed it, this file is the config file for my RecipeDisabler mod.
   * Just a quick warning before getting any further with this mod.
   * While the command helps out with editing the config, it does not apply the
   * changes immediately! In fact, this mod only applies changes upon resources
   * loading. So you have to enable "save on reload" or manually save if you have
   * "auto reload" enabled, and then reload the resources (just the /reload command)
   * And with that being said, enjoy!
   * ~Nerjal
